Box Model in CSS
Properties - 
height, width, margin, padding, border, border-radius
Block element - takes the whole width and begins in the new line. Eg. div
Inline element - Can be placed in the same line as the previous element. Eg span
Display - Sets weather an element is treated as block or Inline and the layout for it's children
display:inline;
display:block;
The default behaviour can be changed using display property
For inline elements(eg span) the properties like height, width doesnot work. Margin gets applied in left and right and not in top and bottom.
Padding works on all sides but may overlap with other elements.
For block elememts it behaves normally
display:inline-block - Used to make the block element as inline conserving the properties which would not appear in case of display:inline
