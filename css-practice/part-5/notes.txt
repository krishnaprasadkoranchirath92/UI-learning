Flexbox - Flexible Box Layout
One dimentional layout method to arrange items in rows and columns

Flexbox Direction - Sets how flex items are places in flex container, along which axis and direction.
flexbox-direction:row; -> x-axis, left to right
flexbox-direction:row-reverse -> x-axis, right to left
flexbox-direction:column; -> y-axis, top to bottom
flexbox-direction:column-reverse ->y-axis, bottom to top

Justify Content - Decides how space is distributed among elements along the main axis.
justify-content:flex-start; // elements get arranged to start of the flex
justify-content:flex-end;// elements get arranged to end of the flex
justify-content:center;// elements get arranged to center of the flex
justify-content:space-between;// elements get arranged with spaces between them and not to side
justify-content:space-around;// elements get arranged with half the space to the end as in between
justify-content:space-evenly;// elements get arranged with same space in ends as in between elements

Flex Wrap: Sets whether items are forced to one line or can be wrapped into multiple lines (Wraps along main axis)
flex-wrap:nowrap; -> Elements forced to one line
flex-wrap:wrap; -> Elements wrapped from top to bottom
flex wrap:wrap-reverse; -> Wrapped in reverse order (bottom to top)

Align Items: Items wrapped along cross axis(reverse of justify-content)
Eg.  align-items:fex-start, 
align-items:flex-end
align-items: center
align-items:baseline (Content inside the boxes come in the same line)

Align Content (Similar to justify content but along cross axis) -
Distributes space between and around contentitems along flexbox's cross-axis
align-content:flex-start/flex-end/center
align-content:space-between/space-arount/evenly
align-content:baseline

Align-self : Align an item along the cross axis
align-self:flex-start/flex-end/center/baseline

Flex sizing - To set the size of flex
flex-basis - defines initial main size of flexitem along thr main axis
flex-grow - Specifies how much of flex container's remaining  space is assigned to item's main size
flex-shrink - Defines shrink factor for the element (reverse of flex-grow)
Flex-grow/ shrink will decide on in what proportion will the left over space be distributed among the flex elements
