React is used to build components (reusable piece of code)
Componenet - Piece of code that has it's own logic and appearance (html+css+js)
JSX - Javascript Extension Syntax
Lets you write html directly in Javascript
Babel - Converts jsx to js Internally
jsx -> Babel -> js

Create Basic react app using vite :
npm create vite@latest  --> create app
cd basic-react-app
npm install --> installs node modules
npm run dev --> runs react app

App.jsx - Parent component (All components come under this)
Has js and html
App.css - Has styling elements for App.jsx
index.html - Main page that gets displayed
 <div id="root"></div>
 <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
main.jsx - Gets the root element and renders App.jsx component
Code is there in App.jsx
index.html -> has root and main.jsx
main.jsx has script that replaces root component by App component
Component - Independent reusable piece of code
All components are embedded inside App.jsx
